# Recip-Ease
 This is the repositiry for Recip-Ease, the Capstone project for Maryville University Software Development Masters Degree. Recip-Ease is a website for the easy creation and storage of recipes.

These files make up the main HTML for the website:
  index.html
  enter.html
  search.html
  signin.html
  share.html
There are two stylesheets: 
  main.css - Main UI structure
  stylesheet.css - Fonts, colors, etc (Created by LESS)
  stylesheet.less - Contains common variables for creating the stylesheet.css to keep UI consistent
In its current state, the webstie has the following Javascript files, generally one per html page:
  commonjs.js
  enterPagejavascript.js
  javascript.js
  search.js
  server.js (contains api routes)
  share.js
  templates.js (for Mustache templates)

Pertinent folder(s) for the website include the images folder for storing the Recip-Ease logo and images for the recipes. node_modules contains the api server files (maybe not necessary for this github, but here they are, and Recip-EaseData, which contains the MongoDB data, etc. Also included is the Design folder with the design documents for this website.
